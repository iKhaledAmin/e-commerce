/**
 * Application service responsible for image processing and physical storage operations.
 *
 * <p>This service encapsulates the complete image lifecycle including:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Image validation</li>
 *     <li>Checksum generation</li>
 *     <li>Image resizing</li>
 *     <li>Variant generation</li>
 *     <li>Physical storage management</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The service creates and returns fully populated {@link Image}
 * aggregates containing all generated {@link ImageVariant}
 * entities.
 *
 * <p><strong>Persistence Responsibility</strong>
 * <br>
 * This service does not perform any database persistence.
 * No repositories are used and no transactions are started.
 * The caller is responsible for attaching the returned image aggregate
 * to its owning entity and persisting it within its own transaction.
 *
 * <p>Typical usage:
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Image image = imageService.create(
 *         request.image(),
 *         ProductImagePreset.DEFAULT,
 *         MediaOwnerType.PRODUCT
 * );
 *
 * product.setImage(image);
 *
 * productRepository.save(product);
 * }</pre>
