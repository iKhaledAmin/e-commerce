/**
 * Represents an abstract system actor responsible for performing actions.
 *
 * <p>
 * An {@code Actor} is a core identity abstraction used across the system
 * to model <b>who is performing an operation</b>, regardless of the underlying
 * source (e.g., authenticated user, anonymous request, system process or may be external service).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * This interface forms the foundation for authorization, policy enforcement,
 * auditing, and cross-cutting concerns where actor context is required.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Conceptual Model</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>{@link Actor}</b> → Business identity abstraction (application layer)</li>
 *   <li><b>{@link ActorSource}</b> → Domain entity representation of identity ownership</li>
 *   <li><b>{@link AuthenticatedPrincipal}</b> → SECURITY representation (authentication layer)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 *
 * <h3>Design Principles</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Decouples business logic from infrastructure concerns (e.g., Spring SECURITY)</li>
 *   <li>Provides a unified representation for all actor types</li>
 *   <li>Enables cross-cutting concerns (e.g., auditing, authorization)</li>
 *   <li>Supports extensibility (Open/Closed) for future actor types (e.g., services, external systems)</li>
 *   <li>Adding new actor type :</li>
 *   <ul>
 *       <li>1- Create new actor class that extends {@link AbstractActor} </li>
 *       <li>2- Create new domain entity [if needed] that extends {@link ActorSource} </li>
 *       <li>3- Create new actor resolver that implements {@link ActorPrincipalResolver} </li>
 *       <li>3- Create new actor resolver that implements {@link ActorSourceResolver} </li>
 *   </ul>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Common Actor Types</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Account actor the authenticated user account (e.g., logged-in user)</li>
 *   <li>Anonymous actor the unauthenticated user (unauthenticated request)</li>
 *   <li>System actor (background jobs, scheduled tasks)</li>
 *   <li>Service actor (inter-service communication)</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Usage</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Used in policy engines to enforce authorization rules</li>
 *   <li>Propagated through application services to evaluate permissions</li>
 *   <li>Serves as the canonical identity representation for business logic</li>
 * </ul>
